We initially tested with version 23.1.x-patch and were later advised to upgrade to the latest version. I'd like to confirm whether we should prioritize the 24.2.0 release or the 24.1.x-patch release.

We began testing with the 23.1.x-patch for several projects and were subsequently instructed to transition to the latest version. I'd like to confirm whether we should prioritize the 24.2.0 release or the 24.1.x-patch release for package build and testing.
